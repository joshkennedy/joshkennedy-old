Designed in the browser using standards-compliant HTML and CSS, I built this site with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass](http://sasslang.com).

I tenderly hand-coded everything in [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com) while sporting the [Spacegray theme](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/). Each page was tested in the latest version of Google Chrome and various other inferior browsers.

The site is set in Freight Sans Pro (bold and light) and Freight Text Pro (book and bold), both served proudly by [Typekit](http://typekit.com).
