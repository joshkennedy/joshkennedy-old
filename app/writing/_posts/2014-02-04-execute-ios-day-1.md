I caught wind last week of [Execute iOS](http://executeios.com), a product launched by Josh Long and Sam Soffes in which Sam teaches Josh how to code an iOS app in three days. 

I'd recently started reading [Execute](http://executebook.com/) (penned by Josh Long and Drew Wilson) and was in an inspired mood to break my "Big Idea" habit by actually bringing something to fruition instead of designing it and promptly leaving it to rot in Dropbox.

I was familiar with Sam's blogging platform [Roon](http://roon.io) and some of his apps (what a portfolio!) and thought this might be an interesting way with which to whet my proverbial iOS whistle.

Additionally, I've decided to document my progress through the stages of learning, designing, and building my own app. The first step has been to watch 44 videos detailing the entire process, from installing Xcode to submitting the finished app to the App Store. Let the fun begin.

I tore through the first 35 videos or so in two days, which promptly left my mind the consistency of jello. I literally dreamed about NSLogs and broken builds. I was happy to take the next few days over Chinese New Year to digest what I'd learned.

My overall impression with the videos has been quite positive. Aside from a few glitches in volume and the speedy nature of Sam's coding, I found the immersive "fly-on-the-wall" perspective remarkably suited to my learning style. It's as close to pair-programming as you can get without actually interacting with anyone.

If I have one gripe about the videos, it would be that very little time is taken to explain much about the syntax of Objective-C. Xcode is an extremely powerful IDE, so simple things like syntax highlighting, inline compiling errors, autocomplete, auto-closing of brackets and parentheses, etc. are handled masterfully. But, I found myself wondering **why** things were being written and puzzling over how I'm supposed to know where and when to include certain bits of code. I'm sure a lot of this confusion came from my attempts to determine the similarities of Objective-C with other languages like Ruby or JavaScript. I found it challenging to unplug from my preconceived notions about the language and look at it with fresh eyes.

Of course, that's not the intent of the course; they even stated as much in one of the videos. I'm perfectly capable of supplementing my education with external resources and plan on doing just that. The purpose of the course is to immerse one in the entire process of building an app from start to finish, and to peek into the workflow of a successful, talented developer.

I finished the remaining videos yesterday and I've been ruminating about what kind of app I'd like to make. One of the common principals of "executing" is to build what you wish existed, so I flitted through my previously purchased apps to see which ones I'd downloaded with high hopes, only to be disappointed that it didn't do X or Y or Z. Inspiration struck, as it inevitably does.

My next task, therefore, is to design the interface for the app. I prefer to work this way, as it allows me to a) get excited for the app, b) decide which features to include (or exclude) and, c) determine the structure and interaction for when I plop into Xcode. 

So stay tuned for day two, coming soon.
