The past three-and-a-half years have been a whirlwind of trial-and-error learning experiences. Singapore is ever-changing; it’s a proverbial amoeba of skyscraper highs and bargain-basement lows. In order to survive in such a fast-paced, career-centric society, one quickly learns to adapt, to re-learn how to learn.

This re-education begins inside each of us at one point or another. There is little argument that we are re-creators by nature. Since the dawn of man’s brief existence on this small, spinning rock, we have taken existing materials and tried to enhance them; to progress further than our fathers. Each person has an innate desire to cultivate the world around them — to bring order out of chaos.

Designers, developers, hairstylists, construction workers, politicians, managers, entrepreneurs, news anchors, retailers, parents — every one of us has a common thread running through our very cores: to take what is and make it better. Be it pixels, code, hair follicles, raw materials, words, ideologies, information or children — products from whatever realm in which we work — we find merit in crafting them into something with a deeper purpose.

Often times this requires sacrifice, which can manifest itself in different ways for different people. A pruned apple tree produces the best fruit. Similarly, a good “product” requires dedication and relinquishment of things that hinder progress. Spouses who dedicate no time cultivating a relationship of mutual love and respect cannot expect a happy, fulfilling marriage.

It’s evocative yet effective to think in terms of “killing” these hindrances. Death has a definite finality. I’ve had to re-learn — sometimes daily — that dealing lethally with things that limit my ability to cultivate the best product is the best way to ensure the purest form of progress.

Whether I’m learning a new coding language, chicken recipe, design pattern, or how to bring out the best in my wife, I must actively seek and destroy all things that impede my progress, thus emulating a sliver of humanity’s life-long search for purpose and meaning.
