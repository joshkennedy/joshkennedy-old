This is the third iteration of the [Roomorama](http://www.roomorama.com) website that I've done. When I first joined the company in 2011, their site needed [some love](http://s3.amazonaws.com/crunchbase_prod_assets/assets/images/original/0006/0154/60154v2.png). I've had the pleasure of working with some extremely talented developers who were ever-patient as I stumbled into this new world of Ruby on Rails.

This latest version, launching soon, is the largest-scale redesign we've done to date. We added a ton of new core functionality and the whole site is responsive. We decided to go with a responsive design in lieu of a separate sub-domain (such as m.roomorama.com) to keep things simple and to have less maintenance. 

For this release we moved entirely to Backbone.js and CoffeeScript and dropped support for IE 7 in the name of progress. With the rollout and subsequent improvements to the IE lineup, users now have a better (but far from perfect) option in default browsers. 

We crammed this whole project into about 4.5 months and are excited to see what our users think!
