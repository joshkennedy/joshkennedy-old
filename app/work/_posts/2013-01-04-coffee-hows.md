[Coffee How's](https://www.facebook.com/coffeehows) is a roastery, cafe and barista school in Seoul, South Korea. 

My wife and I were in Seoul visiting some friends and had the pleasure of visiting this iconic little shop. I was contacted shortly thereafter to design a new logo and bag labels for them. 

I recruited the help of my buddy [Ben Blake](http://drawcoffee.com) ([@drawcoffee](http://twitter.com/drawcoffee)) for the doodles and he nailed it, as always. 

The folks at Coffee How's have been happy with their new branding and recently moved into a shiny new location.
