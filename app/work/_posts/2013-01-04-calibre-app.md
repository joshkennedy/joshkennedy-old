I love [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com). I find it to be the only viable solution for managing and organizing my ebooks. Sadly, each subsequent release of the application is bogged down with features I’ll never use.

I wanted something snappy; something that loads in seconds despite the size of my library; something that doesn't make me feel as if I'm looking at spreadsheets from 2002. 

Enter Calibre 2.0

The [previous version](http://dribbble.com/shots/534762-E-book-Management-App-WIP) of this design was done a while ago and I feel that I've learned a lot since. 

Manage your library. Manage your device. That’s it.

If you or anyone you know is interested in teaming up to tackle the development on this baby, shoot me an email at [hello@joshkennedy.me](mailto:hello@joshkennedy.me).
