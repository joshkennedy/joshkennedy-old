Zleek is a clean, responsive theme I built for [Anchor CMS](http://anchorcms.com). Its purpose is simple: keep the emphasis on content.

With massive featured images for each post and an archive page of all previous posts, there's no much to it. There's nothing extra to get in the way of your words.

It was the first theme I built for the purpose of giving it away, and I've been pleasantly surprised to come across it now and again throughout the interwebs.
